## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-09-25

First release. A C++/Win32 port of
[MacOS-menubar-SnipText-ProUltra](https://github.com/markpelayo/MacOS-menubar-SnipText-ProUltra),
which does the same three things from the macOS menu bar.

It builds clean under `/W4 /WX` and has been run on Windows 11 on one machine.
See [What has and has not been tested](README.md#what-has-and-has-not-been-tested)
for what that does and does not cover.

### Added

- **Screenshot** — region or full screen, opening an annotation editor with
  arrow, rectangle, ellipse, line, freehand pen and text tools. Every mark
  stays selectable, movable, resizable and restylable; undo covers all of
  those on the same footing as drawing, because it stores whole-array
  snapshots rather than a list of added shapes.
- **Screenshot to Text** — on-device OCR via `Windows.Media.Ocr`, with the
  geometry-driven line normaliser ported intact from the macOS version, to
  the clipboard.
- **Record Video** — a resizable region or a whole screen, to H.264 MP4 via
  Media Foundation, with optional microphone audio, selectable frame rate and
  quality, and mouse cursor and click capture. The recorder carries a
  generation number that every asynchronous entry point checks, plus watchdogs
  on the start and stop paths, so it cannot wedge and its finish callback
  fires exactly once per recording.
- **A recording indicator that is actually visible.** A green dashed frame
  around the recorded area, drawn strictly outside the captured rectangle so
  it never appears in the video, plus a `● 00:24  Stop` pill carrying the
  elapsed time that stops the recording in one click. A tray icon is added as
  a second way to stop — but not as the indicator, because Windows 11
  collapses the notification area behind a chevron by default.
- **A pinnable taskbar model**: the first launch stays resident to hold the
  hotkeys, later launches open the menu and exit. While idle there is no
  window, no tray icon, no timer and no background thread.
- Global hotkeys on `Alt+Shift+1` through `6`, in menu order.
- A menu whose first row names the program, its version and its author, so a
  screenshot of it identifies the build.
- Independent output folders for screenshots, text-capture sources and
  videos, each with its own submenu.
- **Sanitize and Restore Default** — saved files to the Recycle Bin, every
  setting back to its default, itemised in the confirmation with live counts
  and with Cancel as the default button.
- Run at Startup, with an optional delay that applies only to a launch
  Windows made after a boot, and a checkmark on the parent row whenever it is
  enabled.
- A plain-text log at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SnipText\Logs\SnipText.log`, self-
  rotating at 512 KB.
- Twenty assertions for the text normaliser covering the six cases that
  shaped the algorithm and the list-marker traps it has to avoid.
- `build.bat` (MSVC, finds Visual Studio itself) and `CMakeLists.txt`, plus a
  GitHub Actions workflow that builds, tests and uploads both the executable
  and the build log on every push.

### Added for the 1.x shakedown

Both come out once the app is polished. They are marked as temporary at their
definitions, listed in [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md), and reverting
is two edits.

- **Verbose logging is on by default.** A machine that has explicitly set
  `debugMode` still wins either way.
- **A startup environment block in the log** — app version and build stamp,
  Windows build number via `RtlGetVersion`, every monitor's bounds and
  scaling, the virtual-desktop rectangle, the process's DPI awareness,
  whether an OCR language is installed, and the three output folder paths. It
  is the context a bug report needs and nobody remembers to include.

### Known issues

- **Hotkeys are not configurable.** `Alt+Shift+<digit>` is unclaimed by
  Windows 11, but another program may already own one. It then silently does
  nothing for the session and the log names it; the menu item still works.
  Changing them is a one-line edit to the modifier mask in
  `RegisterHotkeys()`. Making them configurable is on the roadmap.
- On a full-screen recording the Stop pill has nowhere outside the captured
  area to sit, so it appears in the video. The log says so when it happens.
- Full-screen capture covers one monitor, the one under the pointer.
- Table columns merge into a single line. *Keep Line Breaks* preserves the
  rows.
- No webcam recording and no system-audio (loopback) recording. Microphone
  input works.
- Not code-signed. There is no binary download; build it yourself.

### Notes on the port

The behavioural differences from the macOS original, and the reasoning behind
each, are listed in
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#deviations-from-the-macos-original).
The short version: the app model, the confirmation surface, the recording
indicator, the hotkeys, the container format, the OCR engine and the editor's
Y axis all changed because the platform is different. Nothing else did.
